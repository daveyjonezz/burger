# My Burger Diaries üçî 
## Overview

My Burger Diaries is an app that let's you keep tracker of the burger you want to try and the burgers you've eaten. I bet you didn't realize you needed that until now.

### How does it work?

The diary writer will enter a burger into the *Add a Burger* input field. Once added - the burger will pop up on the left-hand side in the *Burgers to be devoured* column. Once you have devoured the burger, you click the little fork and knife icon and it will move the burger to the *Burgers I have devoured* column. 

The premise is simple, but the value is infinite if you frequently forget what burger places you want to visit. 

### Future Functionality

* Being able to remove a burger completely if it was accidently added.
* Being able to move the burger between columns.
* Having an option to rate the burger.
* Of course, being able to login and have your own personal dashboard.

### Built With:
